- Analysis of COE trends was done on Category A vehicles only.
- Whilst project is a group-based one, each team member was tasked with different responsibilities.
I oversaw the following:
-- Concatenation of Data from various sources into a single dataframe
-- Visualisation of data (bi- and multi-variate) using Seaborn and Plotly
-- Performing both uni- and multi-variate linear regression analyses on data
-- Derviation of conclusion from key indicators like MSE and R^2 variance
