- Analysis of COE trends was done on Category A vehicles only.
- Whilst project is a group-based one, each team member was tasked with different responsibilities.
- I oversaw the following:
- 1) Concatenation of Data from various sources into a single dataframe
  2) Visualisation of data (bi- and multi-variate) using Seaborn and Plotly by using diagrams such as heatmaps, scatter plots, violin plots etc.
  3) Performing both uni- and multi-variate linear regression analyses on data
  4) Derviation of conclusion from key indicators like MSE and R^2 variance
